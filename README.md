Program overview 
This is a snake game made in Java I created this project in my Computer Science 2 class to demonstrate a GUI as my final project.
The game works like any other snake game where a Snake will come across the screen and the user must eat apples to grow the snake if the snake hits the wall or
itself you will loose the game.
